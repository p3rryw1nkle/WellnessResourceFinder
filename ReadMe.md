# Overview

Here's a step-by-step guide that explains how to clone this GitHub repository containing the React (website) project, build it, and launch the website. 

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. **Git:** This is a version control system that lets you download and manage the code from GitHub. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Node.js and npm:** Node.js is the runtime environment required to run a React project, and npm is a package manager used to install dependencies. Download Node.js (which includes npm) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

3. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** This is an editor where you can view and edit the code. Download it from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Cloning the GitHub Repository

1. **Find the Repository URL:** Go to the GitHub page of the React project you want to clone. Click the 'Code' button and copy the URL under 'Clone with HTTPS'.

2. **Open Command Prompt or Terminal:** 
    - On Windows, search for 'cmd' in the Start menu and open it.
    - On Mac, open 'Terminal' from Applications > Utilities.

3. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Type 'pwd' in the command prompt or terminal to see your current working directory. This is what folder you are currently inside and where the project will be installed.
    - 
    - Type `git clone`, then paste the URL you copied. It should look like this: `git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git`
    - Press `Enter`. This command downloads the React project to your computer.
  
4. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    - In the same Command Prompt or Terminal window, type `cd repository-name`, replacing 'repository-name' with the name of the folder that was created when you cloned the repo.
    - Press `Enter`.
  
5. **Open the Project in VS Code:**
    - After cloning, keep the Command Prompt or Terminal window open.
    - Type `code .` in the same window and press `Enter`. This command opens the cloned project in Visual Studio Code.

### Building the React Project

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    - Type `npm install` and press `Enter`. This installs all the necessary dependencies for the React project

### Launching the Website

1. **Start the React Application:**
    - Type `npm start` and press `Enter`. This command starts the React application.
    - Wait for the process to complete. It might take a few minutes.

2. **View the Website:**
    - Once the process is complete, your default web browser should automatically open with the React project running.
    - If it doesnâ€™t open automatically, you can manually open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. This is the local address where the React project is hosted.

### Making Changes in Visual Studio Code

1. **Edit the Code:**
    - In VS Code, browse through the project files in the sidebar.
    - Open any file you wish to change by clicking on it.
    - Make your changes in the file. You can edit text, add new files, or modify existing ones.

2. **Save Your Changes:**
    - After editing, save your changes by pressing `Ctrl + S` (or `Cmd + S` on Mac).
  
### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. **Stage Your Changes:**
    - Go back to Command Prompt or Terminal.
    - Type `git add .` and press `Enter`. This command stages all your changes for commit.

2. **Commit Your Changes:**
    - Type `git commit -m "Your commit message"`, replacing `"Your commit message"` with a brief description of what you changed.
    - Press `Enter`.

3. **Push Your Changes:**
    - Type `git push` and press `Enter`. This command uploads your changes to GitHub.

    *Note: If you're pushing to a repository for the first time or if your credentials are not set up, you might be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.*

### Troubleshooting

- If the repository you're working on is not your own, you might need to fork it before cloning. This creates a copy under your GitHub account.
- Always pull the latest changes from the original repository before starting to work, especially if it's a collaborative project, to avoid conflicts. You can do this by running `git pull origin main` (replace 'main' with the appropriate branch name if different).
- If you encounter any errors during these steps, they are most likely due to missing installations or version incompatibilities. Ensure that Git and Node.js are installed properly. If the problem persists, searching the error message online often provides helpful community advice.
